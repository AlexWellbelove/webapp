## Process
The process of producing this application was one on which I encountered great difficulties.
Nonetheless, I can say that the final product is a representative of my best efforts.

The planning process was not performed to as extensive a degree as desired. If I had spent more time on this stage, the other parts of the process could have been easier as a result.

The development process was marred by difficulties also. It was during this stage that I encountered personal health issues which impacted my ability to work.
Nonetheless, I feel that the main issue in this stage was simply lack of knowledge. At every stage of development I realised that my experience was not sufficient to produce what I wanted. 


## Technologies
The main languages applied to produce this solution were HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
I had plenty of previous experience with HTML and CSS, so these parts of the Web App were easy to implement.
My Javascript experience in comparison was more limited, significantly hindering the ease of the process.
I had also planned to use MySql for the server side of the application, but I lacked the ability and knowledge required to implement this successfully.

Other technologies used in the development process include the npm (node package manager), node.js, git bash and atom.
My experience in the latter made it the ideal choice for scripting parts of the application.
Being lacking in experience in the former three certainly hindered progress in development.
Further limitations imposed by being limited to university hardware also added another layer of difficulty.
