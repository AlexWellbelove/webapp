## Process
The process of producing this application was one on which I encountered great difficulties.
Nonetheless, I can say that the final product is a representative of my best efforts.

The planning process was not performed to as extensive a degree as desired. If I had spent more time on this stage, the other parts of the process could have been easier as a result.

The development process was marred by difficulties also. It was during this stage that I encountered personal health issues which impacted my ability to work.
Nonetheless, I feel that the main issue in this stage was simply lack of knowledge. At every stage of development I realised that my experience was not sufficient to produce what I wanted.
My time management skills were also lacking in this stage, which lead to passing the deadline without a sufficient product.

As a result, the final product does not fully match my initial ideas for the application. If I were to attempt this again, I would set my expectations lower, bearing in mind my ability level.
I would also try to plan my time and stages of development more effectively, to make the development process more streamlined.

## Technologies
The main languages applied to produce this solution were HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
I had plenty of previous experience with HTML and CSS, so these parts of the Web App were easy to implement.
My Javascript experience in comparison was more limited, significantly hindering the ease of the process.
I had also planned to use MySql for the server side of the application, but I lacked the ability and knowledge required to implement this successfully.

Other technologies used in the development process include the npm (node package manager), node.js, git bash and atom.
My experience in the latter made it the ideal choice for scripting parts of the application.
Being lacking in experience in the former three certainly hindered progress in development.
Further limitations imposed by being limited to university hardware also added another layer of difficulty.  

If I were to attempt this process again, I would have placed more emphasis on fully researching the technologies used at an early stage in the development cycle.
I would also have invested in a laptop - using the university systems for this was a nightmare!

## Evaluation and Conclusion
Despite the issues mentioned above, I feel that my best efforts were applied to produce this.
I also learned a lot about the strengths, weaknesses and various applications of the technologies used.
I feel like I learned also about my own strengths and weaknesses and will apply this knowledge going forward.

I have certainly greatly improved my skill in using Javascript, as well as other technologies such as GitHub, npm, node and bash.
I would like to learn more about how to implement database structures into the web application and how to further improve my Javascript.

In conclusion, while attempting this project has been a demanding experience, I have definitely learned a lot both about myself and various technologies from this process.
